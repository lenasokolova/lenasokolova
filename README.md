### 👋 Hi there! 

👨‍💻 I'm Lena, a beginner Software Developer with a graphic design background. For over a year, I deep dove into front-end technologies and programming in JavaScript (ReactJS within its ecosystem).

Creating my own projects, I solve problems that arise along the way and even those I made myself. I like to create complex systems, but also nice interfaces, after all, graphic design is close to my heart. Besides personal projects, I also have experience in team working, thus you can find some team projects on my GitHub. 

### 🌱 Projects

- 🔭 I recommend checking the project I’m currently working on - **Product Feedback Application:  [Demo](https://product-feedback-app-64821.web.app/) | [Code](https://github.com/lenasokolova/product-feedback-app)**

- 👯 Also recommend checking out my last team project - **VOD platform: [Code](https://github.com/intive/patronage22_poznan_js)**

**During VOD platform project I've been working on functionalities such as:**
- [x] Movie Carousel component - create from the basis, responsive behaviors 
- [x] My List Page - search input, communication with API
- [x] Category Page - search input functionality
- [x] Change user information functionality in User Profile

Also, peer code review was on a daily basis. Certainly, collaboration with the QA team was a must.
